        <li>5 tortillas 18cm/7inch</li>
        <li>250g deli meat</li>
        <li>500g potatoes</li>
        <li>5 eggs</li>
        <li>75g mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>2 onions</li>
        <li>200g skyr</li>
        <li>10g basil</li>
        <li>10g mint</li>
        <li>10g vinegar</li>
        <li>10g mustard</li>
        <li>15g oil</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic</li>
        <li>Salt & Pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel potatoes and then cut them into small cubes. Put them into a microwave-safe container and microwave for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>In the meantime crack 5 eggs into a bowl and whisk with a fork. Dice the onions and cut the ham into smaller chunks.</li>
        <li>Add 10g of oil to a pan on medium heat and add in the microwaved potatoes and a pinch of salt. Fry them, stirring occasionally for 5-7 minutes. Then add another 5g of oil and add in onions and deli meat. Keep frying for another 6 minutes. Now add in optional spices. I used 1 tsp of cumin and 11/2 tsp cayenne pepper and toast the spices for 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Now go in with the eggs and cook them for 1 minute stirring constantly. Transfer everything into 2 plates and let them cool down until they don't steam anymore about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>In the meantime add all sauce ingredients into a blender and mix it for 1 minute. Transfer the sauce to a squeeze bottle. The sauce lasts in the fridge for up to a week.</li>
        <li>Prep 5 tortillas, and distribute egg and potatoes evenly on all 5. Add 5g of sauce on top of every tortilla and add 15g of cheese. Roll the tortillas into a burrito shape, wrap them in a paper towel, and put them into a zip log back and then into the freezer.</li>
        <li>If you want to eat them put them straight from the freezer in the microwave for 3-5 minutes or 15-20 minutes in the oven. Done!</li>
